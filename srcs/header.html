	<p class="desc_text">I came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. After founding the Mongol Empire and being proclaimed "Genghis Khan," I started the Mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of Eurasia. These included raids or invasions of the Qara Khitai, Caucasus, Khwarezmid Empire, Western Xia and Jin dynasties. These campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations â€“ especially in the Khwarezmian and Xia controlled lands. By the end of my life, the Mongol Empire will occupy a substantial portion of Central Asia and China.</p>
	<p class="desc_text">Known for the brutality of my campaigns, I am also credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment. This increased communication and trade from Northeast Asia to Muslim Southwest Asia and Christian Europe, thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas.</p>
